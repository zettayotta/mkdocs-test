# Material for MkDocs cookbook

Include some from Notion about various alternatives to document...

- Not comprehensive explanations
- More of a practical, condensed guide based on my preferences


## Prerequisites

- Python
- pip



## Use cases and considerations

*A platform for technical documentation (and possibly other things as well).*

Initially my thought was to rent a new VPS instance for a new documentation system available from the internet. This would succeed my current Wiki.js instance hosted on DigitalOcean.

[**Wiki.js**](https://js.wiki) is very good looking and with a nice set of features, so I’ve been very reluctant to abandon this platform. The major downsides for me though, is the lack of active development. The developer promises huge improvements with the next major release (3.x) but it’s not happening and I’ve been waiting for years now…

→ So what’s the alternatives?

[**Notion**](https://www.notion.so) is really nice, and where I have most of my written documentation (as of 2025). The reason I wan’t to migrate away from Notion over time is the lack of control and ownership of my data (and possibly privacy). On top of that the service is really slow.

[**Anytype**](https://anytype.io) is the new kid on the block with promises of real data ownership, privacy first and E2E encryption. The problem is, it’s still in beta and under heavy development. But I’m paying for the app and hope the future is bright!

[**WordPress**](https://nb.wordpress.org) is where my old blog lives, dating back to at least 2011. For me it’s a bit clunky with all the plugins, themes and shit. Hard to decide on all the options. And good themes/plugins are often pricey.

[**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io) looks good, as presented in the [Cavelab](https://blog.cavelab.dev/2019/01/platform-hopping-hello-hugo/) blog by Thomas Jensen. But probably way to technical for me.

[**BookStack**](https://www.bookstackapp.com) 

[**Outline**](https://www.getoutline.com) 

[**Obsidian**](https://obsidian.md) 

These are probably my best (known) options, but the field is vast and ever changing…


**10/06/2025** Started the server.   
Uploaded the SSH keys for AB-FAST23-WIN on server creation.   
Tested SSH (as root) with PowerShell and VS Code.
